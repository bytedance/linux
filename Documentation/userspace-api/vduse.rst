==================================
VDUSE - "vDPA Device in Userspace"
==================================

vDPA (virtio data path acceleration) device is a device that uses a
datapath which complies with the virtio specifications with vendor
specific control path. vDPA devices can be both physically located on
the hardware or emulated by software. VDUSE is a framework that makes it
possible to implement software-emulated vDPA devices in userspace. And
to make it simple, the emulated vDPA device's control path is handled in
the kernel and only the data path is implemented in the userspace.

Note that only virtio block device is supported by VDUSE framework now,
which can reduce security risks when the userspace process that implements
the data path is run by an unprivileged user. The support for other device
types can be added after the security issue is clarified or fixed in the future.

Start/Stop VDUSE devices
------------------------

VDUSE devices are started as follows:

1. Create a new VDUSE instance with ioctl(VDUSE_CREATE_DEV) on
   /dev/vduse/control.

2. Begin processing VDUSE messages from /dev/vduse/$NAME. The first
   messages will arrive while attaching the VDUSE instance to vDPA bus.

3. Send the VDPA_CMD_DEV_NEW netlink message to attach the VDUSE
   instance to vDPA bus.

VDUSE devices are stopped as follows:

1. Send the VDPA_CMD_DEV_DEL netlink message to detach the VDUSE
   instance from vDPA bus.

2. Close the file descriptor referring to /dev/vduse/$NAME

3. Destroy the VDUSE instance with ioctl(VDUSE_DESTROY_DEV) on
   /dev/vduse/control

The netlink messages metioned above can be sent via vdpa tool in iproute2
or use the below sample codes:

.. code-block:: c

	static int netlink_add_vduse(const char *name, enum vdpa_command cmd)
	{
		struct nl_sock *nlsock;
		struct nl_msg *msg;
		int famid;

		nlsock = nl_socket_alloc();
		if (!nlsock)
			return -ENOMEM;

		if (genl_connect(nlsock))
			goto free_sock;

		famid = genl_ctrl_resolve(nlsock, VDPA_GENL_NAME);
		if (famid < 0)
			goto close_sock;

		msg = nlmsg_alloc();
		if (!msg)
			goto close_sock;

		if (!genlmsg_put(msg, NL_AUTO_PORT, NL_AUTO_SEQ, famid, 0, 0, cmd, 0))
			goto nla_put_failure;

		NLA_PUT_STRING(msg, VDPA_ATTR_DEV_NAME, name);
		if (cmd == VDPA_CMD_DEV_NEW)
			NLA_PUT_STRING(msg, VDPA_ATTR_MGMTDEV_DEV_NAME, "vduse");

		if (nl_send_sync(nlsock, msg))
			goto close_sock;

		nl_close(nlsock);
		nl_socket_free(nlsock);

		return 0;
	nla_put_failure:
		nlmsg_free(msg);
	close_sock:
		nl_close(nlsock);
	free_sock:
		nl_socket_free(nlsock);
		return -1;
	}

How VDUSE works
---------------

Since the emuldated vDPA device's control path is handled in the kernel,
a message-based communication protocol and few types of control messages
are introduced by VDUSE framework to make userspace be aware of the data
path related changes:

- VDUSE_GET_VQ_STATE: Get the state for virtqueue from userspace

- VDUSE_START_DATAPLANE: Notify userspace to start the dataplane

- VDUSE_STOP_DATAPLANE: Notify userspace to stop the dataplane

- VDUSE_UPDATE_IOTLB: Notify userspace to update the memory mapping in device IOTLB

Userspace needs to read()/write() on /dev/vduse/$NAME to receive/reply
those control messages from/to VDUSE kernel module as follows:

.. code-block:: c

	static int vduse_message_handler(int dev_fd)
	{
		int len;
		struct vduse_dev_request req;
		struct vduse_dev_response resp;

		len = read(dev_fd, &req, sizeof(req));
		if (len != sizeof(req))
			return -1;

		resp.request_id = req.request_id;

		switch (req.type) {

		/* handle different types of message */

		}

		if (req.flags & VDUSE_REQ_FLAGS_NO_REPLY)
			return 0;

		len = write(dev_fd, &resp, sizeof(resp));
		if (len != sizeof(resp))
			return -1;

		return 0;
	}

After VDUSE_START_DATAPLANE messages is received, userspace should start the
dataplane processing with the help of some ioctls on /dev/vduse/$NAME:

- VDUSE_IOTLB_GET_FD: get the file descriptor to the first overlapped iova region.
  Userspace can access this iova region by passing fd and corresponding size, offset,
  perm to mmap(). For example:

.. code-block:: c

	static int perm_to_prot(uint8_t perm)
	{
		int prot = 0;

		switch (perm) {
		case VDUSE_ACCESS_WO:
			prot |= PROT_WRITE;
			break;
		case VDUSE_ACCESS_RO:
			prot |= PROT_READ;
			break;
		case VDUSE_ACCESS_RW:
			prot |= PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE;
			break;
		}

		return prot;
	}

	static void *iova_to_va(int dev_fd, uint64_t iova, uint64_t *len)
	{
		int fd;
		void *addr;
		size_t size;
		struct vduse_iotlb_entry entry;

		entry.start = iova;
		entry.last = iova + 1;
		fd = ioctl(dev_fd, VDUSE_IOTLB_GET_FD, &entry);
		if (fd < 0)
			return NULL;

		size = entry.last - entry.start + 1;
		*len = entry.last - iova + 1;
		addr = mmap(0, size, perm_to_prot(entry.perm), MAP_SHARED,
			    fd, entry.offset);
		close(fd);
		if (addr == MAP_FAILED)
			return NULL;

		/* do something to cache this iova region */

		return addr + iova - entry.start;
	}

- VDUSE_DEV_GET_FEATURES: Get the negotiated features

- VDUSE_DEV_UPDATE_CONFIG: Update the configuration space and inject a config interrupt

- VDUSE_VQ_GET_INFO: Get the specified virtqueue's metadata

- VDUSE_VQ_SETUP_KICKFD: set the kickfd for virtqueue, this eventfd is used
  by VDUSE kernel module to notify userspace to consume the vring.

- VDUSE_INJECT_VQ_IRQ: inject an interrupt for specific virtqueue

MMU-based IOMMU Driver
----------------------

VDUSE framework implements an MMU-based on-chip IOMMU driver to support
mapping the kernel DMA buffer into the userspace iova region dynamically.
This is mainly designed for virtio-vdpa case (kernel virtio drivers).

The basic idea behind this driver is treating MMU (VA->PA) as IOMMU (IOVA->PA).
The driver will set up MMU mapping instead of IOMMU mapping for the DMA transfer
so that the userspace process is able to use its virtual address to access
the DMA buffer in kernel.

And to avoid security issue, a bounce-buffering mechanism is introduced to
prevent userspace accessing the original buffer directly which may contain other
kernel data. During the mapping, unmapping, the driver will copy the data from
the original buffer to the bounce buffer and back, depending on the direction of
the transfer. And the bounce-buffer addresses will be mapped into the user address
space instead of the original one.
